## Work Experience

### Rust Development — Elastio (2020–2024)

[Elastio](https://elastio.com) is a startup that provides data backup, recovery, and malware/ransomware detection solution for AWS cloud. Elastio is an AWS Security and Storage Competency Partner.

- As a member of the ‘data plane’ team, I wrote Rust code for mounting network block devices, creating backups of AWS assets (EBS, EC2, AMI), data recovery. (This predates the AWS Backup service.)
- I programmed the integration of Elastio platform with AWS Backup **in a month**. For enhanced protection of user's data, this solution used a logically air-gapped vault when sharing backups between AWS accounts.
- As a member of the ‘anti-ransomware’ team, I developed and maintained Elastio's crown jewel — `iscan` — the software for ransomware and malware detection.
- Optimized performance of network block devices I/O.
